    "Idefix consist of its main trunk (that you downloaded from github, located in `$IDEFIX_DIR/src`) and a user-specified setup, made of at least 3 files (see below). An idefix setup can be located anywhere on your disk. When we will configure and build idefix, we will do it *from the setup directory*. Hence, the main idefix trunk will be built against your setup, and an executable file will be created in your setup directory. Therefore, all of your coding, configuration, compilation and runs should happen in the setup directories proposed in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "In principle, there is *no need* to modify your idefix main trunk, and in particular in this tutorial, it will be left untouched. This separation between the user setup, and the idefix sources limits the risk that you break something fundamental in idefix. Moreover, it simplifies updates, as you just have to `git pull` new versions of idefix in `$IDEFIX_DIR`.\n",

    "For those familiar with the Pluto code, they should feel at home. Indeed, Idefix has been designed to simplify portability from Pluto, so several design features are recovered in idefix.

Any modification of this file requires a recompilation. [More about definitions.hpp](https://idefix.readthedocs.io/latest/reference/definitions.hpp.html) \n",
    "- idefix.ini contains parameters read at *runtime* by idefix. It contains directives organized by blocks [...]. Notably, the domain size, resolution (in the [Grid] block), the Hydro solver, the time integrator, the boundary conditions, etc. There is no need to recompile if you change this file. [More about idefix.ini](https://idefix.readthedocs.io/latest/reference/idefix.ini.html).\n",
    "- setup.cpp contains the C++ code specific to your setup. At minimum it should contain a Setup constructor and a method to initialise the flow. [More about setup.cpp](https://idefix.readthedocs.io/latest/reference/setup.cpp.html)\n",

    "## The problem\n",
    "Our goal is to make a complete planet-disk interaction problem, where we will progressively add more complexity by making our own boundary condition, add a planet, include a passive tracer and even dust grains.\n",
    "\n",
    "The setup provided in problem 1 is a simple 2D Keplerian disk in polar coordinates ($x_1=R,x_2=\\phi$). The initial conditions are already written and defines a surface density profile $\\Sigma=100 R^{-1}$ (the code does not include units). We have also defined the disk aspect ratio $h_0\\equiv H/R=c_s/V_k$, which is read by the Setup constructor from idefix.ini. Here, $V_k$ is the Keplerian velocity, which reads with our units (central Mass=1), $V_K=1/\\sqrt{R}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Define the sound speed\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume the flow is locally isothermal, meaning that we assume the temperature (and therefore the sound speed, since $T\\propto c_s^2$) at each radius $R$ is fixed. As you can see in `idefix.ini`, in the [Hydro] block, we have said that the sound speed is user-defined. This is because we want to tell idefix explicitely which function it should use for the sound speed. To define this sound speed, we are going to assume that the disk aspect ratio is constant, so that $c_s=h_0 V_K=h_0/\\sqrt{R}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we have already started to write a function `MySoundSpeed` in `setup.cpp`, in which we have already gathered the radial coordinate array ($x_1$) and the aspect ratio ($h_0$). The goal of this function is to fill an idefixArray `cs` (that appears as a parameter of this function) that idefix will use to get the sound speed at each point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your first idefix_for\n",
    "Your first task is to invoke an `idefix_for` (read the [doc](https://idefix.readthedocs.io/latest/programmingguide.html#execution-space-and-loops)!). This idefix for should cover the entire domain (or sub-domain if using MPI) of the simulation.\n",
    "The domain extends from $0$ to `data.np_tot[IDIR]` in the x1 direction, $0$ to `data.np_tot[JDIR]` in the x2 direction, and $0$ to `data.np_tot[KDIR]` in the x3 direction (see the [dataBlock documentation](https://idefix.readthedocs.io/latest/programmingguide.html#execution-space-and-loops)). Note that in idefix, it is cusommary to use first the `k` index running on `x3`, then `j` running on `x2` etc. This is to ensure that the fastest running index is always `i` and is also the last  index of every array for optimal performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fill the cs(k,j,i) array and compile\n",
    "Next, you should fill the array `cs(k,j,i)` with the expression we want for the sound speed. This will be the core of your \"compute kernel\", i.e. the code that will be effectively executed by the device. Here, and very often in idefix, this kernel is defined as a `KOKKOS_LAMBDA`, which is a simple, inlined way to define a function to be executed by the device. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you can try to configure (`cmake $IDEFIX_DIR`) and compile the code (`make -j 8`), and it should build properly. However, if you run it, you will get an error message. The reason is simple: we have defined a function to compute the sound speed array, we have told idefix that we were going to use a user-defined function, but we have not said *where* was this function! This is the role played by enrollment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function enrollment\n",
    "\n",
    "The Enrollment is a very common thing in idefix: each time you define a \"user-defined\" function, you need to Enroll it: i.e. tell idefix where it is. For computer people, this can be considered as linking your functions at runtime to the main idefix code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enrollment is usually done in the Setup constructor. Since we have created a function to compute the sound speed, you should enroll it using the `EnrollIsoSoundSpeed` function. You can find the right line commented in the Setup constructor. Uncomment it and recompile the code. It should now run well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### First visualisation of your result\n",
    "\n",
    "The code will integrate the equations of motion for 3 orbital period at R=1. You can visualize the flow with paraview, or with the python blocks below. You should see a weak axisymmetric wave propagating outwards from the inner boundary condition. We will come back to this inner boundary condition later. Next, we add a planet."

    "## Fix the radial boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "As pointed out above, our radial boundary conditions are \"outflow\". This is partly incorrect because we are in a Keplerian disc, so expect $v_\\phi$ to be close to Keplerian, while the outflow copies the last active zone value into the ghost zones. Hence, a better boundary would be to copy the last active zone except for $v_\\phi$, where we would like the flow to be Keplerian in the ghost zones. This means that we need to code our own boundary conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to modify the `[Boundary]` block in `idefix.ini`, to say that you want to use `userdef` boundaries in the X1 directions (at both ends). From this point, idefix will expect you to enroll a function to define the boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then move to `setup.cpp`. You will see that we have already defined a function `UserdefBoundary`, that needs to be completed. So we first enroll this function as a boundary function in the `Setup` constructor (by now, you should know how to do this). Next, we need to define what's happening in the ghost zones of our domain in the `Userdefboundary` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to simplify your life, idefix comes with pre-defined loops on the boundaries, called `BoundaryFor`. These loops are identical to `idefix_for`, but they automatically define their bounds according to the direction and side of the boundary condition to be defined. Our plan is therefore to apply our new boundary conditions by copying the first active zone (with index `iref`) to the ghost zones, except for $v_\\phi$ (`VX2`), for which we want to impose a Keplerian profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once done, you have to recompile and re-run the code. You should see a slight improvement of the solution at the radial boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Restarting/stopping the code\n",
    "\n",
    "As any code, idefix can restart a simulation that have been saved to disk. This is done using the .dmp files (called a dump file), a format specific to Idefix, that contains all of the variables at the precision required during the code configuration. These dump files do not depend on the architecture, you can restart with your favourite GPU a run that started on a GPU. Similarly, you can change the domain decomposition and/or enable/disable MPI altogether. You can also remove/add some physics at restart. The only thing fixed is the total domain resolution and extent: idefix doesn't interpolate from a dump.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our current setup produces one dump every orbit (check the `[Output]` block in idefix.ini). In order to restart from a dump, use the `-restart n` option when calling idefix, where `n` is the dump file number, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "./idefix -restart 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if you omit the dump number `n`, idefix will automatically restart from the latest produced dump file. This can be handy when your run time is limited by the job scheduling of your cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to nicely stop the code while running. Just go to the directory where the code has been launched from, and create an empty `stop` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "cd <running_idefix_dir>\n",
    "touch stop\n",
    "```\n",
    "This automatically makes a dump and stops the code. It is also possible to set a [maximum runtime](https://idefix.readthedocs.io/latest/reference/idefix.ini.html#timeintegrator-section) in `idefix.ini`, and stop the code using [POSIX signals](https://idefix.readthedocs.io/latest/reference/commandline.html#signal-handling). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Add a tracer\n",
    "\n",
    "A passive tracer, or a scalar, is a quantity $\\sigma$ that follows the equation\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\partial_t \\sigma+v\\cdot \\nabla\\sigma=0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $v$ is the fluide velocity. Idefix support an arbitrary number of tracers, on every fluid (i.e. gas and dust).\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable a single tracer to our gas, just add a `tracer` entry in the `[hydro]` block with `1` as a parameter (meaning 1 tracer).\n",
    "\n",
    "This work out of the box, but since we have not defined the initial distribution of our tracer, it will be useless. Therefore, we also have to provide an initial condition for this tracer. In the `InitFlow` function of your setup, you will see that you have commented the initial condition for the tracer. Your task is to uncomment this and define a tracer that is initially 0 for the material inside the planet orbit, and 1 for the material outside of the planet orbit. This will allow us to trace how much material from the outer disc manage to cross the planet orbit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once done, you will have to recompile, run the code, and check what's happening at your tracer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Add dust grains\n",
    "\n",
    "The current public version of Idefix can only treat dust grains as a zero pressure fluid. Idefix can treat an arbitrary number dust fluid, each one representing a dust size.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to set up a configuration, you will need 3 modifications:\n",
    "- enable dust grains in `idefix.ini`\n",
    "- define the initial condition for each dust fluid (=size)\n",
    "- implement the radial boundary condition for the dust fluid, as we did for the gas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enable dust grains in idefix.ini\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, we need to create a new [Dust] block. A block like this is already there and commented in idefix.ini. The only mandatory in this block is the number of dust species, that we set to 1. We additionnally enable a drag force between the dust and the gas. This drag force assumes a constant stopping time, which is kind of incorrect, but is a good first approximation. We set the stopping to 1 code unit. More information on the dust module and its drag force [in the documentation](https://idefix.readthedocs.io/latest/modules/dust.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Define the initial conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the tracer, we need to define the initial conditions for the dust. As usual, this is in the initFlow method, where you will see that we have commented the fields linked to the first dust specie. Each dust specie is identified by an index (here `0`), and has a density and a velocity, exactly like the gas (computationnaly speaking, both are described by the same `Fluid` template class). Fill in the initial conditions for the dust so that it has the same velocity as the gas, with a density equal to 1/100 the gas density.\n",
    "\n",
    "### implement the radial boundary conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the dust is a new kind of fluid, it requires its own boundary conditions. We have already prepared a function for this. You just need to uncomment it and fill in the boundary conditions. Let's use the same conditions as the gas for now. Do not forget to enroll your new function in the constructor!\n",
    "\n",
    "From this point, you can let the code execute. You will probably observe that some regions becomes dust-free while some others tend to be pressure traps. Congratulations, you have finished this tutorial!\n",

    "## Problem 3: GPU segmentation fault\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem 3 is a disk+planet problem. It introduces the concept of additional source files, that are added to Idefix using the ``add_idefix_source`` function in the `CMakeLists.txt` of the setup (check it out). Here, the additional source files defines a new class that compute the sound speed at every point.\n",

    "\n",
    "As you can see with the Kernel logger, the problem is clearly in the ``idefix_for`` called in ``SoundSpeed::Compute``. The problem is actually due to the variables ``Rcoord`` (a 1D ``IdefixArray``) and ``h0`` (a simple scalar). These variables are not defined in the function ``Compute`` but are instead member variables of the class ``SoundSpeed``. From the compiler point of view, these member variables are always accessed through the pointer ``this->`` that point to the current object. Hence, in this particular example, the compiler expands our ``idefix_for`` as:\n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you clearly see the problem: the ``this->`` pointer, that point to the current object, is in CPU space, so the GPU can't find the variable we need. Can you find a way to fix this?\n",

    "This kind of bug is very common and very hard to track down sometimes. Actually, there are entire discussions about this [on the Kokkos repo](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/695)... It turns out it is a defect of the C++ standard. Another workaround is to use ``KOKKOS_CLASS_LAMBDA`` instead of ``KOKKOS_LAMBDA``. This however copies the entire class content onto the GPU, which can therefore lead to a large overhead, and is therefore not recommended for general applications.\n",

    "## Problem 4: a low performance bug.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's move to problem 4, which is again a planet-disk interraction problem. This can be compiled and run *on your laptop* or on the Jureca cluster, but let's focus for now on the GPU version on the Jureca cluster (you can try to do the exercise on your laptop). First go to the right directory\n",

    "At this point, Idefix should run fine and finishes. While we could be satisfied, it's always a good idea to check the code performances, shown in the column cell update/s. This quantifies how many grid cells the code is able to update per second. Note that this number is for the whole code: if you are using MPI, the number of cell update per second should be proportional to the number of MPI processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this particular case, we see that we get a few 1e7 cell updates/s on a single GPU. That's low: if you look at the [Idefix paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230413746L/abstract), you'll see that we typically get at least 1e8 cell/sec on a single Nvidia V100 (that's about 4e8 cell/sec on a full node with 4 V100, see tables 3 & 4), and the test in the paper is 3D MHD cartesian. Our problem is 2D and hydro, so it should be more than this.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several reasons why Idefix could be slower: more complex physics (not quite applicable here), and a too small domain size for each GPU, which is not sufficient to feed all of the computational units of the GPU (reminder: there are 1000s of computational unit in a single V100). Here, the resolution is 1024^2 (more than 1e6 cells), that is equivalent to a 100^3 3D problem. This should be largely sufficient to feed a V100, so we clearly have a problem.\n",

    "### Tracking down performance issue: on-the-fly profiling\n",

    "While there are vendor-specific tools (like Nvidia systems), Idefix seeks portability. It turns out that Idefix provides its own profiling tools: the space time stack. To use it, no need to recompile, just add the `-profile` option when you call the executable\n",

Now that we have understood that the code spends a lot of time in the analysis function, can you find an easy fix to this?\n",
